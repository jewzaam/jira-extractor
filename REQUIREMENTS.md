# JIRA Extractor Requirements

## Overview
A command-line tool for extracting JIRA issues and related issues with configurable export options and relationship traversal.

## Functional Requirements

### Configuration and Authentication

### JIRA API Configuration
- **URL Structure**: `http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name`
- **API Names**: 
  - `api` - for main functionality
  - `auth` - for authentication operations  
- **API Version**: Current version is `2`, with `latest` as symbolic version
- Configuration must specify JIRA server URL and connection parameters

### Authentication
- **Requirement:** Pluggable authentication system supporting multiple methods
- **Supported Authentication Methods:**
  - **Basic Authentication**: Username/password or username/API token (recommended for API tokens)
  - **OAuth 1.0a**: For secure integrations
  - **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**: Authorization code grants for third-party applications
  - **Personal Access Tokens**: For Jira Data Center instances
  - **Cookie-based Authentication**: For browser-based access
- **Security Considerations**: 
  - API tokens preferred over passwords for basic auth
  - HTTPS strongly recommended for basic authentication
  - OAuth methods provide better security for production use

### Export Formats

#### Output Format
- **JSON Only:** All output in JSON format (native JIRA REST API format)

### Extraction Options

#### Single Issue Extraction
- **Default behavior:** Extract only the specified issue
- **API Endpoint**: `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}`
- **Expansion Control**: Use `expand` parameter to control included data

#### Relationship Traversal

##### Subtask Relationships
- **Parent-Child**: Extract parent issues and their subtasks
- **API Support**: Native support through `subtasks` field and parent references
- **Bidirectional**: Can traverse from parent to children or children to parent

##### Issue Links
- **Link Types**: Support for all JIRA issue link types (blocks, depends on, duplicates, etc.)
- **API Endpoint**: `/rest/api/2/issueLink/{linkId}` and issue `issueLinks` field
- **Bidirectional**: Links include both inward and outward relationships
- **Link Discovery**: Query available link types via `/rest/api/2/issueLinkType`

##### Remote Links
- **External References**: Links to external systems and URLs
- **API Endpoint**: `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}/remotelink`

#### Depth Specification Requirements
- **Depth Control**: Specify maximum traversal depth for relationships
- **Depth Values**:
  - `0`: Only the target issue
  - `N`: Traverse N levels from the target issue  
  - `all`: No depth restriction (traverse entire relationship tree)
- **Consistency**: Depth behavior must be uniform across all relationship types
- **Performance**: Implement pagination and limiting to handle large result sets

#### Response Control
- **Field Selection**: Specify which fields to include in responses
- **Pagination**: Handle large result sets with `startAt` and `maxResults` parameters for relationship traversal

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Debug and Logging

#### Debug Mode
- **Default:** Debug disabled
- **Option:** Enable debug mode for detailed operation logging
- **Output**: REST API calls, response codes, relationship traversal details
- **Verbosity Levels**: Support different levels of debug output

#### Logging Requirements
- All output routed through configurable logger system
- **Log Levels**: Error, Warning, Info, Debug
- **Output Destinations**: Console, file, or both
- **API Monitoring**: Log API response times and rate limiting

### Output Management

#### Output Destinations
- **Directory Output**: Save extracted data to specified directory
  - **Creation**: Auto-create directory if it doesn't exist
  - **Preservation**: Existing directory contents preserved unless overwrite enabled
  - **Organization**: Consider sub-directories for large extractions
- **Console Output**: Output to stdout when specified with "-" or "stdout"
  - **Format**: JSON with proper formatting for readability
  - **Usage**: Suitable for quick testing or piping to other tools

#### File Naming
- **Primary**: Each issue stored in separate file named by JIRA key (e.g., `RFE-7877.json`)
- **Relationships**: Option to include relationship data in same file or separate files
- **Metadata**: Optional metadata files with extraction details

#### Overwrite Protection
- **Default**: Fail if file would be overwritten
- **Override**: `--overwrite` flag to allow replacing existing files
- **Backup**: Optional backup of existing files before overwrite

### Command Line Interface

#### Interface Type
- Command-line tool with comprehensive argument support
- Configuration file support for complex setups
- Help system with examples and usage patterns

#### Required Parameters
- JIRA server URL
- Authentication credentials (method-specific)
- Target issue identifier (key or ID)
- Output destination (directory path, or "-"/"stdout" for console output)

#### Optional Parameters
- **Export Control**:
  - `--fields`: Specific fields to include
  - `--expand`: Related entities to expand
- **Relationship Traversal**:
  - `--depth`: Maximum traversal depth
  - `--include-subtasks`: Include subtask relationships
  - `--include-links`: Include issue links
  - `--include-remote-links`: Include remote links
- **Operation Control**:
  - `--debug`: Enable debug logging
  - `--overwrite`: Allow file overwrites
  - `--dry-run`: Show what would be extracted without saving
  - `--config`: Configuration file path

#### Advanced Options
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect JIRA API rate limits
- **Resume**: Resume interrupted extractions
- **Filtering**: Include/exclude specific relationship types or issue types

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: Achieve 90% code coverage for unit tests
- **Test Framework**: Use appropriate testing framework for chosen implementation language
- **Test Organization**: Mirror source code structure in test directories
- **Mock Dependencies**: Mock external dependencies (JIRA API, file system) for isolated testing

### Continuous Integration
- **Pull Request Checks**: Automated checks run on every PR submission
  - **Linting**: Code style and quality checks must pass
  - **Unit Tests**: All unit tests must pass with coverage verification
  - **Build Verification**: Ensure application builds successfully
- **Branch Protection**: PR checks must pass before merge to main branch

### Integration Testing
- **External Dependencies**: Integration tests depend on stable external JIRA API
- **Feasibility**: Full integration testing may not be practical due to API variability
- **Alternative Approach**: Consider smoke tests as lighter-weight verification

### Smoke Testing
- **Purpose**: Quick verification against live JIRA systems with known data
- **Data Requirements**: Use stable, predictable test data that rarely changes
- **Scope Limitations**: 
  - Test only core extraction functionality
  - Avoid dependency on specific issue content that may change
  - Focus on API connectivity and basic relationship traversal
- **Brittleness Mitigation**:
  - Use issues with stable relationships (e.g., archived projects)
  - Test against minimal, controlled datasets
  - Design tests to be resilient to minor data changes
  - Provide clear test data setup documentation

### Test Data Management
- **Test Environments**: Document requirements for test JIRA instances
- **Data Stability**: Identify and document stable test issues and relationships
- **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of test data requirements and setup

## Out of Scope

### Search and Discovery Features
- **JQL (JIRA Query Language) Search**: This tool does not provide search capabilities. Users must provide a known JIRA issue identifier as the starting point.
- **Issue Discovery**: No functionality to find or browse issues. The tool requires a specific issue key/ID as input.
- **Advanced Filtering**: No complex query building or filtering beyond relationship traversal options.

### Data Modification
- **Issue Creation**: Tool is read-only and does not create new JIRA issues.
- **Issue Updates**: No capability to modify existing issues, comments, or metadata.
- **Bulk Operations**: No support for bulk updates, transitions, or modifications.

### Real-time Integration
- **Live Synchronization**: Tool performs one-time extraction, not ongoing synchronization.
- **Webhooks**: No webhook or real-time notification capabilities.
- **Monitoring**: Not intended as a monitoring or alerting system.

### Advanced JIRA Features
- **Workflow Management**: No interaction with JIRA workflows or transitions.
- **Project Administration**: No project configuration or administrative functions.
- **User Management**: No user or permission management capabilities.
- **Custom Field Management**: Read-only access to custom fields, no creation or modification.

### UI/Web Interface
- **Web Interface**: Command-line tool only, no web-based interface.
- **Interactive GUI**: No graphical user interface or interactive features.
