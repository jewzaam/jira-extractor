# Context: User Role and Expectations

## User Profile
- **LinkedIn:** www.linkedin.com/in/naveen-z-malik/
- **Current Role:** Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat (17+ years)
- **Focus:** Staff Engineering Lead, Ansible Engineering - guiding architecture decisions for Ansible Automation Platform
- **Background:** Extensive experience in platform engineering, site reliability engineering, systems architecture, and technical leadership

## Technical Expertise
- **Platforms:** Ansible Automation Platform, OpenShift, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Java
- **Specialties:** Systems design, cross-team collaboration, observability, architecture decision records
- **Leadership:** Mentoring, technical communication, customer engagement, strategic planning

## Communication Preferences
- **Direct feedback only** - No AI praise or unnecessary apologies
- **Concise and factual** - Focus on information and solutions
- **Professional tone** - Straightforward technical communication
- **Repetition** - Do not repeat responses and do not use exclaimations.  For example, do not use "You're absolutely right!" over and over.

## Development Workflow
- **Git branch management:** Always work on feature branches, never directly on main
- **Commit attribution:** Include "Assisted-by: [tool-name] ([model-name])" in commit messages for AI-assisted work, for example: "Assisted-by: Cursor (Claude)"
- **Source attribution:** Include "Generated by: [tool-name] ([model-name])" comments in new source files created with AI assistance, for example: "Generated by: Cursor (Claude)"
- **Proper git workflow:** Before suggesting pushes, remind to:
  1. Ensure on feature branch (not main)
  2. Rename branch to descriptive name if needed
  3. Fetch latest main (`fetch` command)
  4. Commit changes
  5. Rebase on main (`git rebase origin/main`)
  6. Then push to feature branch using option "-u" to set the upstream branch
  7. Open the "Create a pull request" URL
  8. and when asked to "push" do steps above to create a new branch, fetch main, commit changes, rebase on main, and push with -u with a single command

## Review Process
- **Everything AI-generated is reviewed** - User reviews all suggestions, code changes, and outputs
- **Selective acceptance** - User will reject changes they don't like
- **Direct modifications** - User may make their own changes to AI-generated content before proceeding
- **Command approval required** - User will never run commands without reviewing them first

## Collaboration Expectations
- AI should provide direct, actionable solutions
- Changes should be technically sound and well-reasoned
- User maintains final control over all decisions and implementations
- Focus on efficiency and practical outcomes
- Follow established git workflow patterns to maintain clean commit history

## Documentation Preferences
- **Requirements Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive REQUIREMENTS.md with:
  - Clear scope definition (functional, non-functional, out-of-scope sections)
  - Hierarchical organization with consistent formatting
  - Detailed API specifications and technical requirements
  - Explicit testing requirements and coverage targets
- **Test Documentation:** Maintain TEST_PLAN.md with:
  - 1:1 mapping between test plan entries and unit test methods
  - Unique test IDs for easy cross-referencing (e.g., CLI-01, CLIENT-15)
  - Clean table-based organization (Test ID and Description only)
  - Test statistics and usage notes for maintenance
- **Structure Pattern:** Both documents use consistent markdown formatting with clear hierarchies, bullet points, and organized tables

## Command Execution Restrictions
- **NEVER execute sudo or su commands** - No privilege escalation permitted in tool execution
- **Sudo suggestions allowed** - Can suggest sudo commands for user to run manually when beneficial
- **User-level operations only** - All executed commands must run with current user permissions
- **Safe commands only** - Stick to standard development tools (python, git, make, etc.)
- **Project scope** - Commands should be limited to project directory operations

## Technical Environment
- **OS:** Linux (Fedora 42)
- **Shell:** bash
